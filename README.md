## Executive Summary

This report outlines strategic approaches to drive mortality reduction and the well-being of policyholders in Lumania by implementing targeted health incentives. The content delves into the multifaceted benefits that health incentives can yield for both SuperLife and its policyholders. In addition, this document will address how these incentives can not only retain current policyholders but also serve as an attractive feature for potential customers. Therefore, such intervention activities can improve marketability and competitiveness, which could eventually add economic value to SuperLife.

It is imperative that such incentives consider the diverse demographic and socioeconomic landscape of the country to ensure broad accessibility and effectiveness. Of which, the prospect of such incentive programs is evaluated by various quantitative approaches which will be presented in detail below. Also, the components of our programs is selected by prudent analysis to achieve the optimal trade-off between implementation cost and benefits from mortality improvement on targeted age groups.

Our comprehensive research offers insights into the potential short-term and long-term enhancements in mortality rates attributed to adopting health incentives. With concerns of solvency, several tests are conducted on our projecting simulations. By presenting a spectrum of scenarios, from the most optimistic to the most conservative, we underscore the practicality and potential positive outcomes of integrating these health incentives within SuperLife's offerings. Moreover, risks are inevitable for every insurance business, especially before introducing new policies. Risks and their corresponding mitigation methods are also discussed in this report.

In conclusion, the proposed health-incentive activities represent SuperLifeâ€™s commitment to the well-being of its policyholders as well as constant profitability growth and sustainability. SuperLife would strengthen its competitive position and deliver long-term economic value to such an entity by focusing on product innovation, market expansion, and operational efficiency.
